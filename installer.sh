### Functions ###

#Ease of writing functions (repeated logic)

#Log errors to terminal and log file
#Log file name is defined in userinfo.sh
logger(){
    logfile=$LOGFILE
    echo "[$(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $1" | tee -a "$logfile"
}


#Error that stops script
fatalerror(){
    logger "FATAL: $1"
    exit 1
}


#Error that outputs to stderr and continues script (non-severe errors)
error(){
    logger "Non-Fatal Error: $1"
}


#Take in a response for "Are you sure" type questions so as to not need repeated case statement logic
confirmdecision(){
    while true; do
        case $1 in
            y|Y) return 0 ;;
            n|N) return 1 ;; 
            *) error "Bad response"; read -rp "Please enter y or n: " input; set -- "$input" ;;
        esac
    done
}


#Admin packages

#Check if root, on a Debian system, and with stable internet
#Sudo checks if root, apt-get checks if debian, --qq (update lists) checks if internet connection available
checkifroot(){
    sudo apt-get update -qq
    logger "Confirmation: user is root or has sudo permissions. Continuing execution of script."
}


#Install packages
#Attempt installations one at a time, which will log errors if one of the user-entered packages doesn't work
packageinstall(){
    echo "Installing package $1..." && logger "Installing package $1..." 
    sudo apt install -y $1
}


#Install user-provided scripts

#Clone config files from git repo provided in config page and then overwrite basic config files for new installation in ~/.config
#This function is still in progress

    cd "$repo_name"
    pwd
    cd ".."
    #Here cd into the repo, go through the configs and move them to the proper place, etc, etc, etc.

#Desktop environment (optional)

### The Script ###

#Check if user is root

echo "Welcome to Debian Setup Automation. After username and password, the script pretty much runs itself. Errors and logs will be output to $LOGFILE."

#Loop through user-provided array of packages to install one at a time (errors will be thrown for unfindable packages)

packageslength=${#PACKAGES[@]}

for (( i = 0; i < packageslength; i++ ))
do
    currentpackage=${PACKAGES[$i]}
    packageinstall "$currentpackage" || error "Error in installing package ${PACKAGES[$i]}. Does the package exist?"
done

#Install desktop environment if variable has been specified in userinfo.sh

if [[ -n "${DESKTOP_ENV:-}" ]]; then
    echo "You've opted in to installing a desktop environment ($DESKTOP_ENV). Now opening setup window."

#Overwrite basic config files in ~/.config
#this section is currently in progress

#else
#    echo "No config files provided. Moving on."

#Install user-specified scripts

##Probably a similar logic to the above functions, maybe an array like with the packages

scriptslength=${#SCRIPTS[@]}
